# flappy-bird
This is only for practice, I do not own the images, nor do I plan to make any profit from this now or in the future
Issue 1: Cannot load images
Issue 2: Pipes dont leave space for bird or appear with black in between 
Fixed image loading issue
**note** for mac use full path when reading images in
